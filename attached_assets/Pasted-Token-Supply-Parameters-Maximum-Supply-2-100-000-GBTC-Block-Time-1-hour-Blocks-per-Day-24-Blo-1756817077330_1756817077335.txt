Token Supply Parameters

Maximum Supply: 2,100,000 GBTC

Block Time: 1 hour

Blocks per Day: 24

Blocks per Halving: 4,200 (~175 days)

Halving Interval: Every 6 months

Block Rewards & Halving Schedule

Initial Block Reward: 50 GBTC per block

First Halving: After 4,200 blocks (~6 months) → reward = 25 GBTC

Second Halving: After 8,400 blocks (~12 months) → reward = 12.5 GBTC

Third Halving: After 12,600 blocks (~18 months) → reward = 6.25 GBTC

Fourth Halving: After 16,800 blocks (~24 months) → reward = 3.125 GBTC

And so on, until the maximum supply of 2.1 million GBTC is reached.

Launch Timeline (TGE)

The Token Generation Event (TGE) will take place only when the GBTC ecosystem reaches 1 million verified participants. This ensures that the project begins with strong community adoption, global visibility, and network stability.

Mining Phase: Users accumulate mining rewards before TGE.

TGE (Token Generation Event): Official release of GBTC once network participants milestone is achieved 100K - 1Million.

Withdrawals: After TGE, users can withdraw mined tokens directly to their wallets.

Utility & Multi-Chain Expansion

GBTC is not just a mining token — it is built for multi-chain interoperability and real-world DeFi use cases:

1. Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC-style): GBTC can be wrapped and bridged to multiple chains (Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Polygon, etc.), enabling cross-chain liquidity.


2. DeFi Integration: GBTC can be staked, farmed, or provided as liquidity on decentralized exchanges.


3. Bridge Utility: Holders can seamlessly move GBTC between chains for maximum flexibility.


4. BTC Relationship: GBTC mirrors Bitcoin’s scarcity model (but rarer, with only 2.1M supply). Over time, it can serve as a complementary asset alongside BTC, optimized for faster adoption in DeFi.
