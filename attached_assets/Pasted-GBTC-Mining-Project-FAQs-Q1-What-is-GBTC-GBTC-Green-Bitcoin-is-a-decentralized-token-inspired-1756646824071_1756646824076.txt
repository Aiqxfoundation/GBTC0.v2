GBTC Mining Project – FAQs

Q1. What is GBTC?
GBTC (Green Bitcoin) is a decentralized token inspired by Bitcoin’s scarcity model, with a total supply of 21 million tokens and a fair mining + hashrate-based distribution system.

Q2. How can I start mining GBTC?
First, sign up with Google. Then deposit USDT into the project’s main wallet, purchase hash power, and start mining. Without a deposit, your hash power = 0.

Q3. What is hash power?
Hash power represents your mining strength. The more USDT you spend to buy hash power, the more GBTC tokens you earn per block.

Q4. How are tokens mined?

Every 10 minutes = 1 block mined.

Active miners share the block reward based on their purchased hash power.

If you don’t claim daily, your account is marked inactive, and you don’t receive rewards until you return active.


Q5. What happens if I fake a deposit transaction?
Your account can be frozen or blocked permanently. Only real blockchain transactions are accepted.

Q6. Can I withdraw mined tokens?
No, mined tokens can only be transferred between existing users inside the system until 25% of total supply is mined. After that, GBTC becomes tradable on exchanges.

Q7. What can I withdraw now?
You can only withdraw USDT earned through referral commissions.

Q8. How does the referral system work?
When your referral purchases hash power:

Level 1 (direct): You earn 10% USDT commission.

Level 2 (indirect): You earn 5% USDT commission.


Q9. What is “Purchase Power”?
It’s where you choose how much USDT you want to spend (via a slider, e.g., 1–100 USDT or more). That USDT converts into hash power instantly.

Q10. What is the supply model?

Total supply = 21M GBTC.

Blocks mined every 10 minutes.

Supply gets harder as more miners join (reward per block decreases).

At 25% mined, GBTC lists on exchanges. Mining continues long-term with decreasing rewards.


Q11. Can I transfer tokens to anyone?
Yes, but only within the system (user-to-user transfer) until listing.

Q12. Why is the system fair?

Rewards depend on real investment (hash power).

Inactive users don’t get free tokens.

Global supply calculator ensures transparent tokenomics.

Admin cannot manipulate balances—only approve deposits/withdrawals.


Q13. What does the Admin control?
The Admin can:

Approve/Reject deposits.

Approve/Reject withdrawals.

Freeze/Unfreeze accounts if rules are broken.


Q14. What happens if I don’t claim my mined tokens daily?
Your hash power becomes temporarily inactive, and you skip that block’s reward. You start earning again from the next block after reactivation.

Q15. Why invest in GBTC?
Because it’s designed as a fair mining project, with real scarcity like Bitcoin & Ethereum, long-term growth potential, and USDT-backed incentives for referrals and power purchase.
